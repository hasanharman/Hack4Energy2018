# HackforEnergy2018
This is very basic a smart solution demonstration for smart offices.

  We had second place in Hack for Energy with this project in Teknopark Ä°zmir's hackathon. 
  
  Project based on reducing energy consumption in the offices and technoparks etc. According to our research main consumption is electricity which are lights, climate systems etc. 
  We focused on solving these problems so we put heat sensor to measure temperature instantly. When the temperature is high our fan start to work and decrease temperature. Secondly, we had distance sensor to reduce consumption based on light. Our idea was when nobody working at his/her desk there will be no light on. Otherwise light is on. We don't use movement sensor because the distance sensor is easier honestly :) That's the technical part of this project. As I told It was very easy to build and show. We had 48 hours to finish our project and present it. The key point is in the presentation. You can think, this is the easiest project I've ever seen. That might be true but, we showed our abilities and vision in the presentation.
  
If you want to add something or develop the project please push your ideas. All ideas appriciated :)
